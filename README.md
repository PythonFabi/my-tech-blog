# My Tech Blog

## Description

This app was created for anyone to post their blogs about anything in the tech field.
You can post, edit and delete posts, that you created yourself and you can comment on yours or other posts as well once you are logged in or signed up.
I leaned how to use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) to create a dynamic application that connects frontend and back-end together in a very efficient
manner. 
Happy blogging!

You can see each blog show's the title, content, the author and the date on which it was created. 

If you click any of the links or the blogs, you will be redirected to the login page or you can simply just click on the login link. 

Once you reach the page you can either login if you have an existing account, otherwise click on the link to sign up instead.

After signing up, you will be automatically logged in as well and redirected to the dashboard.
