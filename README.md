# My Tech Blog

## Description

This app was created for anyone to post their blogs about anything in the tech field.
You can post, edit and delete posts, that you created yourself and you can comment on yours or other posts as well once you are logged in or signed up.
I learned how to use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) to create a dynamic application that connects frontend and back-end together in a very efficient
manner. 
Happy blogging!
